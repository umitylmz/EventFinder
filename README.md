# EventFinder


EventFinder is an android application which helps user to find events around him or with a custom search. Search can be done with
4 different parameters which are category, time, location and keyword.

Events are shown on a recyclerview with its image, start time and name of event. When an item on recyclerview is clicked, details of 
events are shown with explanations.

In addition, EventFinder uses its database to store events informations which are found by the user on previous searches and uses them 
on next searches.
